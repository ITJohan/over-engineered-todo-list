# Over Engineered Todo List

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the following technologies:
1. React Context API
2. Spring Boot
3. Swagger
4. Flyway
5. Docker
6. SonarQube
7. Microsoft Azure
8. Jenkins

## Plan
These will be done by implementing a todo list where the user can:
1. Create todos
3. Read todos
2. Update todos
4. Delete todos
5. Mark todos as done

This is the todo list for the todo list:
1. <s>Create GitHub repository</s>
2. Setup CI/CD pipline with Jenkins and SonarQube
2. Implement a frontend with React (without backend-calls)
3. Implement a REST API with Spring Boot using only in-memory todos
4. Connect the backend and frontend
5. Create documentation for the REST API with Swagger
6. Implement a database with PostgreSQL and Flyway for schema migration
7. Pack the frontend, backend and database in to a docker-container (should be able to start everything with "docker compose up")
8. Deploy the container to Microsoft Azure
9. Make it possible to share todos with another user
    1. Implement authentication using Spring Security + Azure AD / Google / Facebook
    2. Implement authorization
10. Implement a mobile frontend with React Native
